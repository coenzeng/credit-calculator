# Credit calculator
Calculates annuity and differentiate payments.

Use creditpayments.py or monthpayments.py if the missing variable that you want to figure out is the credit or the amount of months, respectively. 
Use part3.py if you want all the options (annuity, month, and credit principle).

differentiate.py requires you to enter a command line argument.
